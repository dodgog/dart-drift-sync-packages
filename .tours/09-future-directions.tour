      "description": "# Hybrid Logical Clock Persistence\n\nA critical TODO in the codebase addresses the need to persist Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) state. Currently, HLC is initialized on database startup but doesn't maintain state across restarts.\n\n## Current Implementation Limitation\n\nThe current implementation initializes HLC using the current physical time when the database opens. While this works for basic operations, it has potential edge cases where timestamp continuity might not be maintained across database restarts.\n\n## Proposed Enhancement\n\nThe TODO suggests storing HLC state directly in the database as an attribute. This would ensure that when the application restarts, it can resume with the last known logical time, maintaining the critical monotonicity property of HLCs that ensures proper event ordering in a distributed system.",

Bundles can contain events (in their payload), but there's no explicit tracking of which events belong to which bundles once they've been processed.\n\n## Proposed Enhancement\n\nThe comment proposes creating a formal relationship between events and bundles, potentially through a dedicated relationship table. This would enable:\n\n1. Better traceability of event origins\n2. Improved query capabilities for finding events by bundle\n3. More efficient bundle management and cleanup\n4. Enhanced debugging capabilities\n\nThis enhancement would make the system more robust for complex synchronization scenarios where understanding event provenance becomes critical.",

This approach is simple but has limitations.\n\n## Conflict Resolution Limitations\n\nThe current conflict resolution in the `insertEventIntoAttributes` function uses a simple timestamp comparison (`WHERE excluded.timestamp > attributes.timestamp`), which means:\n\n1. Later writes always win, regardless of semantic meaning\n2. No opportunity for merging conflicting changes\n3. No user involvement in conflict resolution\n\n## Advanced Strategies\n\nMore sophisticated conflict resolution could include:\n\n### Semantic Merging\nUnderstanding the meaning of changes to intelligently merge conflicting edits\n\n### Three-Way Merging\nUsing the common ancestor of conflicting changes to perform better automatic merging\n\n### Operation-Based Resolution\nTrack and merge operations rather than just final states\n\n### User-Assisted Resolution\nInvolve users in resolving complex conflicts by presenting options when automatic resolution isn't possible\n\nImplementing these strategies would significantly enhance the system's ability to handle complex collaborative scenarios.",

Performance degradation for large event logs\n\n## Proposed Enhancements\n\n### Event Log Pruning\nSelectively removing old events that are no longer needed for historical purposes while maintaining system integrity.\n\n### Periodic Snapshots\nCreating point-in-time representations of the complete system state to avoid replaying all events from the beginning.\n\n### Incremental Snapshots\nCapturing only changes since the last snapshot to minimize storage requirements.\n\n### Compaction\nCombining multiple sequential events into a single logical state-change event while preserving the final outcome.\n\nThese techniques are common in mature event-sourced systems and would significantly improve performance and storage efficiency as applications built on this framework scale up.",
