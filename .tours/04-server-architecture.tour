This interface establishes a clean separation between the server's external API and its internal implementation details.\n\nThe interface includes three essential methods:\n\n1. **initialize()** - Sets up the database schema and prepares it for operation\n2. **interpretQueryAndRespond()** - The central method for handling all client requests\n3. **createAuthedUserAndClient()** - Creates new user accounts with authentication\n\nThis abstraction enables multiple potential implementations (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production) while maintaining a consistent API surface. By designing the server around this interface, the system achieves better testability through mocking and greater flexibility for future database backends.",

If a match is found, the user is authenticated; otherwise, access is denied\n\nWhile this implementation is straightforward, it provides the foundation for a secure system. The authentication is performed at the database level rather than in the HTTP layer, which unifies the security model regardless of how the server is accessed.\n\nIn a production environment, this would likely be enhanced with features like:\n- Token expiration and rotation\n- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks\n- More sophisticated encryption for the tokens\n- Role-based access control",

This enables efficient resumption of synchronization after network interruptions or client restarts.\n\nBy separating bundle discovery from bundle retrieval, the system allows clients to implement sophisticated synchronization strategies based on their specific needs and network conditions.
