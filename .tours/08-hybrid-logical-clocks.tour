      "description": "# The Time Problem in Distributed Systems\n\nTime synchronization is one of the most challenging aspects of distributed systems. This documentation outlines the core problems that the system must address:\n\n1. **Clock Skew** - Different devices have different physical clocks that may be out of sync by seconds, minutes, or even hours\n2. **Ordering Events** - Need to establish which events happened \"before\" others, even across different devices\n3. **Causality** - If event A causes event B, A must be ordered before B in all views of the system\n4. **Partial Ordering** - Not all events have direct causal relationships, yet we need a consistent ordering\n\nThese challenges are particularly relevant to this system because:\n- Mobile devices often have inaccurate clocks\n- Offline operation means events may be generated without server connectivity\n- Multiple devices may generate conflicting events that need deterministic resolution\n\nTraditional approaches like relying solely on device wall-clock time or simple server-assigned timestamps are insufficient for a robust distributed event sourcing system with offline capabilities.",

      "description": "# Hybrid Logical Clocks Theory\n\nHybrid Logical Clocks represent an elegant solution that combines the best aspects of both physical and logical clock approaches:\n\n1. **Physical Clocks** - Use actual time from device clocks\n   - Advantage: Timestamps are meaningful to humans\n   - Disadvantage: Clocks can be wrong or skewed\n\n2. **Logical Clocks** - Use counters to establish ordering\n   - Advantage: Perfect for tracking causality\n   - Disadvantage: No relation to real-world time\n\nHLCs combine these approaches by using a tuple of (physical time, logical counter, node ID) where:\n- The physical component stays close to real time\n- The logical counter handles causality tracking\n- The node ID breaks ties for simultaneous events\n\nThis hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds: timestamps that are meaningful to humans while still ensuring proper causality across a distributed system even when device clocks are not perfectly synchronized.\n\nThe system employs HLCs as the cornerstone of its distributed time synchronization strategy, ensuring consistent event ordering regardless of when and where events are created.",

      "description": "# Client Clock Setup\n\nEach client in the system must initialize its own HLC instance during database startup. This single line of code is more significant than it might initially appear.\n\nThe HLC initialization accomplishes several critical functions:\n\n1. **Node Identity** - The client's unique ID becomes part of the clock's identity\n2. **Local Clock Seeding** - The physical clock is used as a starting point\n3. **Logical Counter Reset** - The logical component starts at zero\n4. **Singleton Creation** - Sets up the HLC as a global singleton for the client\n\nBy placing this initialization in the database's migration strategy, the system ensures that the clock is properly set up before any database operations that might generate timestamped events. This ordering is crucial - events should never be created with uninitialized or improperly configured clocks.\n\nThe ClientNode wrapper around the client ID enables the HLC library to identify this node in the distributed system. This identity becomes part of every timestamp generated by this client, enabling event origin tracking throughout the system.",

This can be valuable when tracking the flow of events through the system.\n\nThe placement of this initialization in the database migration strategy ensures that the server's clock is properly configured before it begins processing client requests. This is essential for maintaining the integrity of the distributed timestamp system.",

This format ensures that timestamps can be compared lexicographically, with the physical component providing the primary ordering.\n\nThe timestamp generation happens at key moments in the system: when creating events, when creating bundles, and when responding to client requests.
